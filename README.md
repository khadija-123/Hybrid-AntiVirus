- **Heuristics** + **Tiny ML-like scorer** (JSON coefficients, no sklearn/lightgbm required)
- **GUI with Tkinter** (choose file/folder and scan)

**Why it will run on your machine**
- No LightGBM
- No scikit-learn pickles
- ML is a small logistic scorer implemented in pure Python with JSON weights
